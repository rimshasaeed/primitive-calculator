# Primitive Calculator
A primitive calculator has been programmed that can perform the following three operations with the current number X:
- subtract 1 from X
- divide X by 2
- divide X by 3

Given a positive integer n, the calculator determines the minimum number of operations needed to obtain 1 starting from the number n.
